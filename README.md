Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This course project was for a pirate game that contain starter files Game Experience, TreasureHuntGame, and TreasureMaze files. The Game Experience file was utilize to store the agent's progress within the game. The TreasureMaze file contains the all the coordinates that were used for this game. The TreasureHuntGame file has some parameters already available for use and also has the instruction needed to successfully implement a solution to guide the agent in solving the puzzle.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists discover solutions to complex problems with the help from technology. These techiques use mathematics, algorithms and logic to design programs with the capabilities to be tested with hardware and software. This provides plenty of flexibility so it can be utilized by various industries such as the alpha go assignment that this course offered. In the assignmnet the alpha go utilized different concepts of machine learning techiques. These concepts shows that they have potential to do some amazing things that can be applied in numerous ways.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach to a problem as a up and coming computer scientist is to first evaluate the inital question I can ask to gain an understanding of what's causing the problem. When a thorough evaluation is conducted of the question that were ask I would recommend possible solutions that could help resolve the task at hand.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsibilities as a developer is to respect the users privacy by applying the most secure features to protect their information. With all of the recent data breaches security has been brought to the forefront and as a result of these events the general public has a lack of confidence in companies to properly secure their sensitive information. As a developer I'm on the first line of defense. To help with security I always use secure coding standards with programming. This can help with protecting the system by ensuring that all the code written is up to the most stringent coding standards for security purposes.
